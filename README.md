Microsoft Visual C++, usually shortened to Visual C++ or MSVC, is the name for the C++, C, and assembly language development tools and libraries available as part of Visual Studio on Windows. Visual C++ can be used to write anything from simple console apps to the most sophisticated and complex apps for Windows desktop, from device drivers and operating system components to cross-platform games for mobile devices, and from the smallest IoT devices to multi-server high performance computing in the Azure cloud.
